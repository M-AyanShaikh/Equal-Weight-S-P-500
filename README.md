# Equal-Weight-S-P-500
The goal of this Python application is to accept the value of your portfolio and tell you how many shares of each S&amp;P 500 constituent you should purchase to get an equal-weight version of the index fund.

With this project being built as a .ipynb file, more details of this application can be found by downloading and opening the file in Jupyter Notebook.
